BIG MOUNTAIN RESORT
In this project, the data of the 330 resorts in the US was investigated to recoup the increased
operating costs of the Big Mountain Resort.
In order to recompense the costs from the new chair lift, a raise to the price of an adult
weekend-weekday chairlift tickets was taken into account. Names, regions and states of the
resorts were not considered since they have not impacted the model.
According to the model result, summit elevation and projected days open in the upcoming
season are directly proportional with the cost of an adult weekday-weekend chairlift ticket:

Total number of days open last year and projected days open in the upcoming season are
related by accurately.

All in all, according to the model result, it is seen that extension of the projected days open in
the upcoming season is beneficial for the resort, and a raise to the price of an adult weekend
chair lift ticket is very appropriate. And the ticket price should be around $82.12.
